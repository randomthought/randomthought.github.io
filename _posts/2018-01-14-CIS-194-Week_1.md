## Learning Haskell

I have decided to take on the journey of learning functional programming myself. Please check out Uncle Bob's video[^1] on functional programming if the concept is new to you. They are plenty of good resources to teach you the concepts. Most notable is the legendary _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_[^2] (SICP). SICP is defiantly a book I want to tackle one day but for now, I wish to learn Haskell[^3] so I can have a cool Xmonad[^4] setup.

So where to start? I am following Chris Allen's[^5] recommendations on learning Haskell hence this course is my first course followed by Data64[^3] and Stanford's CS240H[^5]. Yup, it's going to be a long journey but as they say... you eat and elephant a bite at a time.

I work a lot with Spark's Scala environment and plan to start using Xmonad[^4] soon so this should help accelerate my understanding of the concepts. So, my journey starts here. Brent Yorgey's CIS 194 Course[^6]. These problems are not easy, some of them require some time with a pen and paper so do not feel discouraged. If you are planning to learn Haskell using this course. Please give every problem a try before referencing at my answers.

My answers might also be wrong, I am attempting the problems myself without much help. Feel free to comment below if you notice an error or can think of better way to write a solution.

**Exercise 1** We need to first find the digits of a number. Define the functions

```
toDigits    :: Integer -> [Integer]
toDigitsRev :: Integer -> [Integer]
```
`toDigits `should convert positive Integers to a list of digits. (For 0 or negative inputs, `toDigits` should return the empty list.) `toDigitsRev`should do the same, but with the digits reversed.

```
Example: toDigits 1234 == [1,2,3,4] 
Example: toDigitsRev 1234 == [4,3,2,1]
Example: toDigits 0 == []
Example: toDigits (-17) == []
```

**Solution**

{% highlight haskell %}
toDigits :: Integer -> [Integer]
toDigits n
 | n < 1    = []
 | otherwise = toDigits (div n 10) ++ [mod n 10]

toDigitsRev :: Integer -> [Integer]
toDigitsRev n 
    | n < 1     = []
    | otherwise =  mod n 10 : toDigitsRev (div n 10)
{% endhighlight %}
___

**Exercise 2** Once we have the digits in the proper order, we need to double every other one. Define a function

```
doubleEveryOther :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
```

Remember that doubleEveryOther should double every other number beginning from the right, that is, the second-to-last, fourth-to-last... numbers are doubled.

```
Example: doubleEveryOther [8,7,6,5] == [16,7,12,5]
Example: doubleEveryOther [1,2,3] == [1,4,3]
```

**Solution**

{% highlight haskell %}
doubleEveryOther :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
doubleEveryOther [] = []
doubleEveryOther (x:[]) = x*2 : []
doubleEveryOther (x:(y:zs)) = x*2 : y : doubleEveryOther zs
{% endhighlight %}
___

**Exercise 3** The output of `doubleEveryOther` has a mix of one-digit
and two-digit numbers. Define the function

```
sumDigits :: [Integer] -> Integer
```

to calculate the sum of all digits.

```
Example: sumDigits [16,7,12,5] = 1 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 22
```

**Solution**

{% highlight haskell %}
sumDigits :: [Integer] -> Integer
sumDigits []     = 0
sumDigits (x:xs) 
    | x < 10     = x + sumDigits xs
    | otherwise  = sumDigits(toDigits x) + sumDigits xs
{% endhighlight %}
___

**Exercise 4** Define the function

```
validate :: Integer -> Bool
```

that indicates whether an Integer could be a valid credit card number.
This will use all functions defined in the previous exercises.

```
Example: validate 4012888888881881 = True
Example: validate 4012888888881882 = False
```


**Solution**

{% highlight haskell %}
validate :: Integer -> Bool
validate n = sumDigits (doubleEveryOther (toDigits n)) `mod` 10 == 0
{% endhighlight %}

**Exercise 5** The Towers of Hanoi is a classic puzzle with a solution that can be described recursively. Disks of different sizes are stacked on three pegs; the goal is to get from a starting configuration with all disks stacked on the first peg to an ending configuration with all disks stacked on the last peg.

> This problem is very interesting and enlightening, please give it a try before looking at the solution. If you are still struggling. Please try to play the game slowly [here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html). and lastly, a hint. Once your base-case are covered, notice that moving an n number of begs from a to b is simply Hanoi n a c b. Use that to solve the recursive pattern. I have also included a video below that explains the solution.

{% include youtube.html id="WPSeyjX1-4s?t=20m10s" %}

For this exercise, define a function hanoi with the following type:

```
type Peg = String
type Move = (Peg, Peg)
hanoi :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move]
```

**Solution**

{% highlight haskell %}
type Peg = String
type Move = (Peg, Peg)

hanoi :: Integer -> Peg -> Peg -> Peg -> [Move]
hanoi 0 a b c = []
hanoi 1 a b c = [(a, c)]
hanoi 2 a b c = (a, b) : (a, c) : hanoi 1 b a c
hanoi n a b c = hanoi (n-1) a c b : hanoi 1 a b c : hanoi (n-1) b a c
{% endhighlight %}
